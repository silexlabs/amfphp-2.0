/**
 * Filters are provided by Amfphp to allow your contexts to 'filter into' the rest of Amfphp, i.e. to call functions in your context at specific times<br />
 * Call addFilter to register a filter, with a default priority of 10, and call callFilter to actually execute the filter
 *
 * The data structure is as follows:
 * all registered filters : associative array ( filter name => name filters)
 * name filters : associative array containing filters for one filter name (priority => priority filters)
 * priority filters: numbered array containing filters for one filter name and one priority [callback1, callback2, etc.]
 *
 * So for example if you were to call:
 * addFilter("FILTER_1", $obj, "method1");
 * addFilter("FILTER_1", $obj, "method2");
 * addFilter("FILTER_1", $obj, "method3", 15);
 * addFilter("FILTER_2", $obj, "method4");
 *
 * the structure would be
 * "FILTER_1" => array(
 *                      10 => [callback for method1, callback for method2]
 *                      15 => [callback for method3]
 * "FILTER_2" => array(
 *                      10 => [callback for method4]
 *
 * This is a singleton, so use getInstance
